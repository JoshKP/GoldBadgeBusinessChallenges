# GoldBadgeBusinessChallenges
This is a collection of three console apps addressing three different business challenges built in Visual Studio 2019 using C#.  
Each application addresses a different business challenge and provides a unique solution for the business.  The applications
have full CRUD functionality and also include Unit Tests for all of the functions.

The first challenge allows a cafe manager to Create, Read, Update, and Delete all aspects of a food menu for its customers.

The second challenge utilizes Queues and full CRUD to catalog insurance claims for its customers and also to determine whether a
claim is valid based on the amount of time between the date of the incident and the date of the claim.

The third challenge utilizes a Dictionary to manage security access for its employees.  It allows an admin full CRUD control over the badges and also the doors that a badge has access to.

To run a challenge open this solution in Visual Studio and set the corresponding UI file as the Start Up project, i.e. KomodoMenuUI, 
KomodoInsuranceUI or KomodoBadgeUI.  Next click Start with the green arrow at the top (or press control+F5).  After that you can interact with the application through the console.
